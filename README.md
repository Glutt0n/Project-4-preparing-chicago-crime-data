## Analysis of Crime Data provided by the City of Chicago
Our data consists of all recorded crimes dating to 2000 up to the present.
### We will be analyzing the following topics:

#### Comparing Police Districts:
- Which district has the most crimes? Which has the least?
#### Crimes Across the Years:
- Is the total number of crimes increasing or decreasing across the years?
- Are there any individual crimes that are doing the opposite (e.g decreasing when overall crime is increasing or vice-versa)?
#### Comparing Months:
- What months have the most crime? What months have the least?
- Are there any individual crimes that do not follow this pattern? If so, which crimes?
### Findings through Visualizations:
- Crimes per District:

District 8 had the most crimes, while district 20 had the least. 

- Total Crime per Year

We see a steady decrease in crime up until about around 2022 where crime spikes slightly. Overall, crime is decreased.

- Individual Crimes per Year

We can see that individual crimes: 'theft' and 'motor vehicle theft' went in the opposite direction for a time towards the end of our plot.

- Total Crime per Month

Our plot shows us that May, July, and August have the highest counts of crime among all months. It also shows January, February, and December having the least crime.

- Individual Crimes per Month

Some crimes such as, deceptive practice, public indecency, ritualism, stalking, and other rarer crimes do not follow this pattern, likely due to them not being very common crimes in the first place. They don't have much of a trend at all. Their trendline is rather flat.
